# PyAutoBuild: PyAuto Build Server

PyAutoBuild is the **executor** of the PyAuto release ecosystem — it builds, tests and deploys, but runs no release-readiness checks (those belong to [PyAutoPulse](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoPulse); the [PyAutoAgent](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoAgent) release agent gates on `pyauto-pulse readiness` before dispatching a release). See `AGENTS.md` for the boundary.

This project performs automatic building, testing and deployment of projects in the PyAuto software family:

- [PyAutoConf](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoConf)
- [PyAutoFit](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoFit)
- [PyAutoArray](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray)
- [PyAutoGalaxy](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoGalay)
- [PyAutoLens](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoLens)
- [PyAutoCTI](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoCTI)

It uses their associated workspaces:

- [autofit_workspace](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autofit_workspace)
- [autogalaxy_workspace](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autogalaxy_workspace)
- [autolens_workspace](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace)

And their test workspaces:

- [autofit_workspace_test](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autofit_workspace_test)
- [autogalaxy_workspace_test](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autogalaxy_workspace_test)
- [autolens_workspace_test](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace_test)

The build pipeline includes the following tasks:

- Package and release all projects to the test_pypi server.
- Install all test packages via pip.
- Run all project unit tests.
- Run all workspace integration test scripts.
- If successful, release packages to pypi.
- Update workspaces with new test scripts.

This automatically runs every 24 hours.

## CLI Usage

Every operation is invokable from the shell via the `autobuild` dispatcher:

```
bash bin/autobuild help                    # list every subcommand
bash bin/autobuild help <subcommand>       # full docstring for one
bash bin/autobuild pre_build [minor]       # full pre-build flow
bash bin/autobuild verify_install          # release-readiness gate
```

Recommended alias for `~/.bashrc`:

```
alias autobuild-help='$HOME/Code/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoBuild/bin/autobuild help'
```

The dispatcher wraps both bash scripts and Python tools, so any operation in
this repo is reachable from a single entry point with consistent `--help`
documentation.
