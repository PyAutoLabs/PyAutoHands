# PyAutoHands — Agent Guidance

(The repo was renamed PyAutoBuild → PyAutoHands in 2026-07; the `autohands`
CLI/package name and the *Build* call-chain shorthand were kept — see
[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) and `PyAutoBrain/ORGANISM.md`.)

PyAutoHands is the **executor** (the Hands) of the PyAuto release ecosystem:
packaging, tagging, notebook generation, and PyPI publication via `release.yml`.
**PyAutoHands executes work on behalf of PyAutoBrain.** It runs no
release-readiness checks of its own — that is PyAutoHeart's job.

## The boundary

The organs, boundaries and the `Brain → Heart (gate) → Build (execute)` call
chain are defined once in `PyAutoBrain/ORGANISM.md`. Build's side of it:
**pure executor** — it runs no readiness checks of its own and never
re-derives a gate decision; readiness is gated upstream by the Brain via
`pyauto-heart readiness`.

## What moved out of Build

Release-readiness checking is no longer Build's job. The version-skew gate, the
deep `verify_install` suite, and URL hygiene all live in PyAutoHeart now;
`autohands verify_install` / `autohands url_check` / `autohands watch|status|
tick|fix` are thin shims that delegate to `pyauto-heart`. Build keeps only the
executor primitives: the build/notebook pipeline (`pre_build`, `generate*`,
`run_all` / `run*`), the navigator catalogue and the workspace guards, tagging +
release (`tag_and_merge`, `bump_colab_urls`, `release.yml`), the release-notes
and Slack tooling (`generate_release_notes`, `slack_release_notes`), the release
board (`board`, published by `release_board.yml`), assistant seeding
(`clone_seed`), and `repro_command`. `bin/autohands help` is the **complete**
registry of `autohands/` — every module there is a CLI verb or an
`INTERNAL_MODULES` entry, enforced by `tests/test_autohands_registry.py`, so
read `help` rather than listing verbs here. See `docs/internals.md` for the
pipeline detail.

See [`docs/internals.md`](docs/internals.md) for the build pipeline, workspace
folder structure, config files, and `release.yml` details. Read it when
changing the pipeline itself, not by default.

## Remote sessions (Claude Code on web and mobile)

Three facts, all measured in a web/mobile container, where this file is loaded
and little else is. They ride in every organ because a session may hold any
subset of them — and the session that needs this most is the one holding
several, which is exactly the session no hook fires in.

- **Bootstrap in the first turn, unconditionally** — before the first test
  command, not as a remedy once something looks wrong:

  ```
  bash PyAutoMind/scripts/session_bootstrap.sh          # ~10s cold, ~1s warm
  bash PyAutoMind/scripts/session_bootstrap.sh --check  # report only
  ```

  A session holding several organs registers no SessionStart hook — Claude Code
  reads project hooks from the project directory, which in that layout is the
  repos' *parent*, not a repo — so nothing has set this session up. It was once
  phrased as a remedy keyed to `No module named pytest` or collection
  `ImportError`s naming `yaml`; that symptom stopped appearing when the
  container image moved to Python 3.12, while the environment is still wrong in
  ways that read like a bad command rather than a stale session (`pytest -n
  auto` → `unrecognized arguments: -n`). The bootstrap also **unshallows the
  clones**: a remote session clones shallow, and `git merge-base --is-ancestor`
  then answers "not an ancestor" for a commit whose ancestry is merely absent —
  the answer the ship and close-out procedures act on when proving a branch
  merged.

- **Then run the suite in parallel.** 4 cores, subprocess-heavy suites, no
  single slow test: about 3.5x. `python3 -m pytest -q -n auto`, with
  `pytest-xdist` supplied by the bootstrap above.

- **There is no `gh`, and installing one does not help.** A remote session
  reaches GitHub through the `mcp__github__*` tools, already scoped to the
  session's repos. `gh` installs in two seconds and is a trap: it authenticates,
  then 403s every repo-scoped call, because the egress proxy serves neither the
  REST repo paths nor GraphQL beyond a pinned set of PR-review operations — a
  binary that looks healthy and fails everything that matters. It also defeats
  the surface probe, which keys off `gh auth status`. Read
  `PyAutoBrain/skills/GITHUB_ACCESS.md` at the top of any run that touches
  GitHub; it maps each `gh` operation onto its MCP tool. Spell that path from
  the workspace root, as written: a multi-organ session is cwd'd at the repos'
  *parent*, so a bare `skills/…` reads as a missing file rather than a missing
  repo prefix.

## Never rewrite history

Never rewrite pushed history on any repo with a remote — no `git init` over a
tracked repo, no force-push to `main`, no fresh-start "Initial commit", no
`filter-repo` / `filter-branch` / `rebase -i` on pushed branches. To get a
clean tree: `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main && git clean -fd`.
